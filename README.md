# Clean MVP-Template for Swift

All you need to start using MVP in your iOS project. 
This Clean Architecture divides an appâ€™s logical structure into distinct layers of responsibility, makes it easier to isolate dependencies, maintain and test your iOS project of any size!

## Integration


## Install xCode File Templates

### Using terminal
Open terminal and then run ```sudo swift install.swift```

### Manually
Copy folder `/Modules/MVP.xctemplate` to `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates/`

Ok. Now you should be able to find new MVP template in `New File` menu under the section named Modules (probably, the last one).

## Add Base interfaces
Copy file named files from direcory `BaseInterfaces/MVP` to your project.
